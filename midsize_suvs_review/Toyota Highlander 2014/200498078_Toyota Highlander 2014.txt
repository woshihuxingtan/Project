This car is quite pricey.  I wouldn't have even thought about buying it if I hadn't gotten 20K trade-in for my Tacoma.  For the price, the quality is not that great.  The shiny, cheap looking wheels disintegrate if you brush a curb and it costs $600+ to replace each one (not including labor).  There are tiny spots missing paint from a bad paint job on the assembly line.  Both front windows make a terrible loud screeching sound when you put them up and they hit the frame.  And lastly, if you make chrome roof rails, why would the only option for roof rail bars be in cheap looking black plastic?

Ordered a to-be-built 2014 Limited in late February, 2014 and took delivery 3 weeks later.   Alumina Jade Metallic (green) over tan/almond leather interior.  Came from a 1997 Camry LE (186k miles) and a 2003 Honda Pilot (177k miles).  I had been long researching the former Highland and current Honda Pilot.  The Pilot is too boxy and I grew tired of all the hard plastics (though they do keep well with kids)>  The former Highlander IMO was a little to soft for me in interior design.  Let me just say that I absolutely love this vehicle.

Bought a Limited AWD to replace our old 05 Odyssey minivan.
Good looking vehicle especially in maroon with black interior.
We shopped Mazda and Honda (their products were dated) and Acura MDX (overpriced in my opinion).
Got out the door with the tech package for $38K.
Good value but at a cost.
The interior design is quite nice, but there is evidence of cost-cutting in the hard plastic materials below arm level, the fell of some of the switchgear, and in the carpet (it feels like trunk liner material).
It rides well, handles securely and has plenty of power when pushed, but it does drive "big" and the engine is coarse; the Odyssey's engine was stronger and sounded better.

We have a Volvo XC70, Honda Accord, Mustang. Added Highlander to get 7 seats. It's good, but suffers in comparison to the others.

Nice inside, but nothing like the Volvo. Drives fine, but not *fun* like the Accord, Mustang. It's an SUV, so it's doomed to be a lummox.

Front of car looks nice. Rear: odd!

JBL stereo: Sound was muddy, bad. Dealership clueless. I finally discovered, in an Entune menu that was *not* Audio, a setting for "surround sound." Changed it to "stereo." Was like a veil was lifted. Still, the sound seems all up in the dashboard -- you must slide the fader nearly all the way back to get sound from all around.

Overall: Competent, quiet, boring. That's Toyota!

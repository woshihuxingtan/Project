I purchased this 1500 9-1-14 to replace my aging Titan (10 years old).  The dealership was offering some great incentives for the holiday and the truck seemed to be rated pretty good so I thought it was a no-brainer.  Until, I took it over my friends house (concrete driveway) and he informed me that I leaked transmission fluid all over it.  I then looked under the truck and sure enough, it was leaking.  Well, it has been to the dealer 4 times now and they still are having trouble fixing it.  It is now at the dealer again.  When they picked it up this morning, it had 1568 miles on it and most of them are from them doing test drives.  Contact Chrysler support yesterday and waiting them...

I thought these hemi engines got poor mileage but this 4x4 gets over 20 mpg just driving back and forth to work. This truck blows away ford and chevy in every category. looks better, rides better,nicer interior with more options that come standard. Drive one if your in the market for a new truck. It sells itself, and was priced better. I did have a negative bias against the dodge truck but seeing is believing.
